# android-transition-anim
Just some simple Android Transition animations, for my blog post ["Android Activity transition slide in/out animation"](http://madcoda.com/2013/09/android-activity-transition-slide-in-out-animation/).

## Usage
Copy the 4 .xml files into <code>res/anim</code> folder of your Android project. Then you can reference in your code as e.g. <code>R.anim.pull_in_left</code>
